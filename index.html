                She received help from Gloria Estefan who helped her learn English and worked hard for this album.
                Her smash hit single "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" sold more than a million copies in the United States.
                Her sixth studio album Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 became the best-selling Latin pop album and second best selling Latin album in general of the 200's in the U.S.

            <h3>Legacy and Impact</h3>
            <p id="id1">
            It is no doubt that Shakira is a huge icon/figure in the Latin music.
            New York Times has even gone far enough to call her the 
            <strong>"Titan of Latin Pop."</strong>
            In 2010, Google came out saying that Shakira was the most searched female entertainer of that year.
            A handful of artists have named Shakira an influence such as Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, etc.
            In a 2017 article by Fortune, she was named one of the "World's Greatest Leaders".
            </p>
            <p id="id1">According to Britannica Academic, in 2003 Shakira became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF.
                By being an ambassador, she was able to bring into a better light the struggles that children in poorer countries are facing.
                Along with that she had created an organization called the Pies Descalzos Foundation (named after her third studio album) which centered on violence against children in Colombia.
                The foundation focused on five schools across Colombia which helped aid and feed 4,000 kids.
                The World Literacy Foundation made an announcement that Shakira will be awarded the 2020 Global Literacy Award for
                "her significant contribution to the improvement of literacy for disadvantaged children around the world."
            </p>
            <p id="id1">
            Shakira had an article written from The Guardian about how her impact on Colombia's education and bringing social awareness.
            She was fortunate enough to sit down and communicate these issues with Barack Obama.
            She has used her platform to not only be a pop music icon, but to also spread her political messages.
            Her influence clearly is not limited to a bubble, she is an inspiration and ilustrious.
